# Subtitle-finder
Takes locaction/name of a file and returns the link to subtitle

## Overview
It takes input from the user and checks whether the file is of audio or video type. Then, we use web broswer automation to find subtitles for the video file and lyrics for the audio.</br>
For video, www.moviesubtitles.org/movies.html and http://www.tvsubtitles.net/ are used. This is a general use case scenario where users need subtitles.</br>
For audio, www.mldb.org/search is used to find lyrics of a song.
The program returns the browser window with the address to where to download the movie from.

## Requirements
**Python 3.x**</br>
**Firefox Browser**</br>
**Selenium** pip install selenium.</br>
**Geckodriver** It is included in the repository, so you just have to run the code in file_subtitle.</br>

Your contributions are always welcome.
